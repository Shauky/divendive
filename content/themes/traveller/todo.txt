Todo on current task


-- BoatWrapper   includes the search too
  -- Tourcat
    --Search form
     --Boatlist
      -- boat

  - PhoneCat (yellow)
    - SearchForm (red)
    - PhonesList (orange)

Keep it simple

Build tour components with reactjs (data, icons included) 
Change Authors/ Licence files
Sever angular to handle data and forms from app itself. Angular now served from content folder

Dont refresh page, layout, layout....phonecat next
 - Bring contact form and boat page upto date
 			Boat form
 			Link buttons <--- icons, List, Rate, Like, Share   (react)
 			Writers, offers

 - torture myself by learning perl

Minimum marketable features
Serve react
	 -  Browse boats by itinerary 
	 -  Give details of tour, itinerary   <--- later stage
	 - Search by price and intinerary

	 - Dive holidays bottom link should have more blog entires on left, then packages on the right

*** Engineering task
	- Look into mongodb storage using Node and react
	- Boat listing, search/ Later all properties
		Schedule needs to be selectable, by boat, price, itinerary
		Then booking form
		Then email

		- Dive holidays Json
		- Writers Json
		- Offers Json

	- Contact page

	- Small Json/Angular form for entries. Manager page

	- Tour listing/ Liveaboard 
			Needs to go to booking form


	- Booking form


Bugs
- Cant select text on blog
- require needs full path for files, ghost problem?
- Require manifest doest update immediately -- (usually three refreshes)

- Serve data 
	with Loopback\
    	 strongloop
     	loopbuntub2 localhost 8000 serves mean app 
     	                                             2368 serves ghost   
     	                                             ****localhost 8080 services strongloop 
     												  *mongodb://localhost:27017/boatDB serves mongo

		Connect react on the client (html)
		Connect to mongo datasource
    	// browserify -r ./content/themes/traveller/assets/js/trvrapp.js > ./content/themes/traveller/assets/js/bundle.js
		Connect db to mms.mongodb.com
